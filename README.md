# PriceCo-Sales-Analysis
This project explores customer sales data for PriceCo using Power BI. The goal was to generate effective insights for decision-makers to develop strategies that increase the average customer ticket size.
## Research Questions
- Is the city of purchase related to the average sales ticket?
- Is gender related to the average sales ticket?
- Is the type of membership related to the average sales ticket?

## Key Insights
1. Guadalajara reported the highest overall sales.
2. Female customers had slightly higher sales tickets than male customers.
3. Customers with a **Normal membership** spent slightly more per ticket than those with a **Plus membership**.

## Business Impact
- Focus marketing on underperforming cities to boost sales.
- Create targeted campaigns to close the gender spending gap.
- Re-evaluate the Plus membership value proposition, as current data suggests Plus customers spend less than Normal members.
